While color varies, the body shape is consistently recognizable.* **Fins:**  The presence of fins (dorsal, caudal, anal, pectoral, pelvic) in a characteristic arrangement for a fish.* **Scales:** The presence of scales covering the body.* **Eyes:** Prominent eyes on the sides of the head.* **Gills:**  While not always directly visible, the understanding that a goldfish breathes through gills is essential to its classification.While bright orange color is common, it's not essential. Goldfish come in many colors, and a non-orange fish with the other features would still be recognized as a goldfish.  Similarly, while a long flowing tail is common in certain breeds, it's not universally present."
